## Become a Bedrock Developer
Bedrock is based on a basic static site generator called [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and has been modified to become its own version. So understanding the [Quartz documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) is the basis for understanding the nature of this project's source code!

Bedrock requires **at least** [Node](https://nodejs.org/) **v20** and `npm` **v9.3.1** to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.
