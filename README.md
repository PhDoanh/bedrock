# You have found the backstage of [Doanhanma](https://phdoanh.github.io/doanhanma/)! üëè

**Hello explorers!** This is the repository of the Doanhanma project‚Äôs source code, explaining how the website's interface, content, and functionality work. This project focuses on organizing Markdown documents into a public collection for everyone, writing about my personal knowledge, work, and life... and even showcasing other fantastic projects! 

**Special thanks to Quartz** üôè, a basic static site generator that has magically transformed my individual Markdown files into a user-friendly blog! If you're interested, you can learn more about it [here](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

‚òùÔ∏è Note:
- This is a personal project but that doesn't mean you can't collaborate. This has been discussed [here](https://github.com/PhDoanh/doanhanma/discussions/39)!
- I would appreciate it if you find a web bug and report it to me through [this](https://github.com/PhDoanh/doanhanma/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D+)!
